# Computational-Methods-For-Data-Analysis
Five projects demonstrate different exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biological sciences.
* [Hunting for a submarine](https://github.com/yuminyin/Computational-Methods-For-Data-Analysis/tree/main/Hunting%20for%20a%20submarine "Hunting for a submarine") illustrates the MATLAB implementation of a fast Fourier transform and Gaussian-based spectraul filtering applied to a real-world scenario. To begin, we first uses the fast Fourier transform to convert the data into the frequency domain. After that, to take the advantage of the key that the noise is white, i.e., it has zero mean, we average over realizations to cancel out the noise in order to figure out the center frequency. Lastly, we define our filter as the Gaussian function and determine the trajectory of the submarine by filtering the data around the center frequency. 
* [Rock & Roll and the Gabor transform](https://github.com/yuminyin/Computational-Methods-For-Data-Analysis/tree/main/Rock%20%26%20Roll%20and%20the%20Gabor%20transform "Rock & Roll and the Gabor transform")
